# LotteryApp
It is a small Android 4 application for creating and storing lottery tickets. It is part of a curse on my university.

## Changes:

### Version 1
It is possible to create a lottery ticket, edit and store it.
Also old tickets can be loaded and edited.
###Version 2
The tickets are stored in an sqlite3 database(internal Android db). Three new activities were added and also new layouts for the activities.
###Version3
The app has a service which checks periodically in the background if a new ticket is available at a special webservice. Tickets can be verified with the last ticket that was fetched from the server. Action bars with tabs were added.
##Nice to know
This is not really a serious project, it is(like above mentioned) just part of a course and I have to do it. So if you download this file, you are in my course....just do me a favour and deliver this assignment after me!
If you AREN'T in my course there is NO guarantee that this piece of code works or doesn't harm your phone!!(It works on an emulator....)

By the way ... github's md rendering rocks:-)
